# ansible-nginx-simple
Simple Ansible Script to get NGINX running on CentOS 7 using Vagrant

The Goal is to have a NGINX up and running quickly so it can be used as a starting place for development.  It's all in one file (vagrant.yml) to help keep things clean and simple.  

Feel free to clone and modify however you see fit.
